### Why **Storyboard <i class="fa fa-book"></i>**?

- Presentations are dead.
- Stories live forever.
- We want stories with pictures and graphs.
- It should look good on mobile.

Beginning a new slide

You separate your content into different slides by marking the start of a line with two pound signs (###). What follows on the same line of the two pound signs is the title of your slide. Anything on a fresh line becomes the body of your slide.

If you like bullets, precede each bullet item with a dash (-).

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

### **Images <i class="fa fa-picture-o"></i>** with a side panel

***

You can include images with exclamation-point square-brackets parentheses. The caption goes inside the square brackets and the file location of the image goes inside the parentheses. You can hotlink to images on the Internet, but this could hurt you if you present in a room with no Internet connection.

### Including R **code <i class="fa fa-code"></i>**

You can include brief snippets of R code using the backtick r (`r) followed by the R code snippet and another backtick.

This version of the presentation was printed on `r date()`.

Any substantial R code must be placed inside a chunk. Chunks start with a triple backtick left-curly-brace r right-curly-brace followed by your R code followed by a triple backtick.

```{r echo=TRUE}
grades <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "F")
sample(grades, 10, replace=TRUE)
```

For many presentations, you will want to hide the underlying R code with the option echo=FALSE.

Here's a list of grades with my detailed grading algorithm kept quiet.

```{r echo=FALSE}
grades <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "F")
sample(grades, 10, replace=TRUE)
```

### Including **plots <i class="fa fa-area-chart"></i>**

```{r simple-plot, fig.cap="Figure 2. Go figure."}
x <- seq(0, 1, length=1001)
y <- dbeta(x, 2, 9)
plot(x, y, type="l")
```

### Math equations

You can use TeX code to create simple or intricate math formulas.

$I_x(\alpha, \beta) = \int_0^x \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)} {\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)} t^{\alpha-1}(1-t)^{\beta-1} dt$

$\Phi(x)= \int_{-\infty}^{x} \frac{1} {\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-t^2/2} dt$

**You can include a bibliography**

If you specify bibiography: in your yaml header and point to a bibtex file, you can cite references and put a bibliography at the end of your talk. In one of my talks I mentioned [@bellazzi2012] and [@chen2018]. The full citations appear as the very last page.
